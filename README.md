## Search Query
 I have integrated Fuse.js into my React application to provide advanced search functionality. 
 Fuse.js offers powerful features such as fuzzy search, enabling users to find relevant results even when their query is not an exact match. 

In this app, the key attributes you can search for include tags, description, address, zip code, year built, number of beds, and number of baths. I have used Fuse.js to perform searches across all of these fields, generating results based on their relevance and score.

For example, 

 1) Searching for the string 'sun' in our application will yield results that include homes located in Sunnyvale, as well as properties with tags and descriptions containing the keyword 'sun'.
 2) Searching for 'sunlight' will narrow down the search and provide you with the most relevant results. This search term will focus on properties with tags, descriptions, or other key fields containing the keyword 'sunlight,' helping you discover homes that meet your specific preferences.
 3) Search for "wood" to get homes with hard wood floors.
 4) Other search terms: tesla, RV, single family, 94587, palo

The output is sorted based on relevance, prioritizing properties with tags, descriptions, or other key fields containing the keyword.
